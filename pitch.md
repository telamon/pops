# The Picoverse

## Problem

Personal website & creator platforms are being increasingly locked down:

- Instagram is account-walled, ads.
- Facebook, account-walled, ads.
- Tumblr, account-walled, ads.
- Square-space, monthly fees + transaction shares
- Wordpress.com, ads, monthly fees.
- Shopify, monthly fees + transaction shares

The ambitions and resource requirements for a modern website generate overwhelming
development and server costs that are continually pushed onto the consumer.

It's time to reboot.

## Solution

The Pico\* protocols aim to create a distributed content delivery network using easy to implement data storages (we call them silos) that are free or paid, decentralized or otherwise.

The `POP` specifications add to what is known as the _Progressive Web Application_ specifications and 
gently detach them from their HTTPS dependencies.

Think of it as ronin webapps that wander between hosts but belong to no server.

A Pico web app has many advantages:
- Remove deploy complexity an dependencies.
- Does not care where it's loaded from.
- Does not own it's users and never their data.
- Functions happily with or without an connection.
- Is tiny and compatible.

The recent emergence of the `nostr` network, provides a viable alternative to bootstrap p2p applications,
we'll try to be compatible with it and other such networks where it makes sense.

## Vision

The original vision in early 202x was to create a generative Internet that is compact enough to fit on a 64GB thumb drive,
downloadable for offgrid ventures or relayed in the spirit of sneakernet.

I thought it would be better that everyone should have their own internet, because most likely we already do.

The vision is the next iteraton of communication and it is not a small undertaking,
luckily we're not alone.

There are multitudes of independent actors all devloping new public patent free specifications,
forming the scaffolding for a digital network without a super node.

So may the fittest specs evolve into standards.
