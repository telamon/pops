# POP-0101: 19bit PoW MEM

`status: draft`

A scheme is proposed to generate a tagged key on handheld devices,
in addition to regular anonymous keys.  
Each user generates secrets until they find a keypair
that they like.

The target difficulty is < 10 minutes on a low-end phone in a browser environment.  
The goal is to incentivize the emergence of "calmer" data stores
respecting the rule that _data belongs to user_.

This is not meant to generate exclusivity, but a rough form of indexing.

### Components

## 2bit Age

| Key | bits | Value |
|-----|------|-------|
| 0   | 00   | 16+   |
| 1   | 01   | 24+   |
| 2   | 10   | 32+   |
| 3   | 11   | 48+   |

## 2bit Gender

| Key | bits | Value      |
|-----|------|------------|
| 0   | 00   | Female     |
| 1   | 01   | Male       |
| 2   | 10   | Non Binary |
| 3   | 11   | Bot        |

## 15bit Geohash (156Km accuracy)

This component is scaleable and should not be taken as truth.
Mining it too far will impact anonymity of the entire network,
cause exclusion, borders and general mayhem.

15 bits chosen as initial difficulty simply because it fits 3 quintets - future will provide better values.

### Relative XOR-Distance
Relative distances for query-filters can be cheaply calculated using the XOR operation on two binary hashes.
